# Terraform Configuration

This document explains how to structure Terraform files, define resources, and manage multi-cloud infrastructure using Terraform.

## Structuring Terraform Files

- **main.tf**: The primary Terraform configuration file where resources are defined.
- **variables.tf**: File to declare input variables used in Terraform configurations.
- **aws/, azure/, gcp/**: Directories for cloud provider-specific Terraform files.
- **backend.tf**: Terraform backend configuration for remote state storage.
- **variables.tf**: Terraform variables file.

## Defining Resources

### AWS

- Use AWS-specific resource providers (`aws_`) to define EC2 instances, S3 buckets, etc.
- Configure authentication using access keys, secret keys, and regions.

### Azure

- Utilize Azure-specific resource providers (`azurerm_`) to define resources like virtual machines, storage accounts, etc.
- Set authentication and define resource properties.

### GCP

- Define resources using GCP-specific providers (`google_`) for Compute Engine instances, Cloud Storage buckets, etc.
- Authenticate using service account keys and set necessary configurations.

## Managing Multi-Cloud Infrastructure

- Utilize appropriate providers and resource types based on the cloud services required across different providers.
- Leverage Terraform's modules and conditional expressions for better scalability and maintenance.

Your Terraform configurations should be organized and catered to the specific needs of provisioning infrastructure across multiple cloud providers.
